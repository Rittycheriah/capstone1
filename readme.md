realTr@cker: An app to track realtor feedback and showings
==========================================================

The purpose of this app was to get rid of a much beloved 
spreadsheet from my previous career. While the spreadsheet 
was adorable, we needed a better solution with an easy to use 
user interface. 

> Register an account
> Login in with that account
> Add any properties in a property manager's roster
> Change the occupancy status for the property populate in the main page
> Once populated, each time the property gets a call or showing, users can: 
> * Count phone calls
> * Count showings
> * Record feedback from showings
